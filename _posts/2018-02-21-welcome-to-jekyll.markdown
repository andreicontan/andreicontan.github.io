# I AM what IAM - testing in digital transformation
* proposed EclipseCon
Quite a few years ago, augmented reality entered our daily lives imposing digital perspectives on reality without actually ‘touching’ it. Devices like phones, tablets, televisions and cars only enrich information and our experiences for all kinds of reasons. But lately it shows that this was just the beginning of a major transition where those devices are not merely ‘dumb’ things that provide information; they’re able to actually ‘do’ things on their own. Interacting with consumers as well as with each other is making them part of our human reality.

This is a testing invitation to explore together the opportunities and hands-on experience of a test architect role in the world of IAM, deployed in a micro services environment.

We will walk through the risk based approaches of the most important 3 IAM pillars that the current project is offering
* Sharing and securing personal identity data -. Organisations in the midst of digital transformation need this information in a multitude of IT systems. Sharing and securing this data is a core functionality of IAM.
* Access and Authorisation - Making sure only data is shared which is needed, but also making sure the right access is granted to the right people is key to IAM.
* Provide people with the right tools to protect their privacy - As incorporated in the EU’s GDPR legislation, organisations should expose the data they have on individuals and ask for consent when necessary.

Join the session to challenge through testing the ‘simple’ notions of login, registration, authentication and authorisation

# POCs - a different approach in building testing strategies
## Session: Talk
* Madrid - ExpoQA
### Abstract:
Initiatives of new testing approaches within your company are subject of many
unknowns and most initiatives suffer fatal setbacks.

One solution in the test automation world - proof of concepts (POCs) - a piece of software, developed by us the testers, which allows us to collect the maximum amount of learning in a specific context with the purpose of making a point to our stakeholders (team, managers, clients).

While building and presenting proof-of-concepts is not only about opportunities and creative genius, taking the approach in the area of software testing contributes decisively to the success of test automation journeys.

When talking about test strategies kick-off, the lean startup philosophy enabled a shift in the way I was perceiving test automation and also build significant more trust between stakeholders.

Starting with brainstorming sessions, to creating a minimum viable product or minimising the total time through the build-measure-learn feedback loop are stages which contributed to the success of our test automation strategy efforts.

During the talk, I would like to share with you the key learnings of my journey in applying lean-startup mindset in building testing strategies and POCs.

### Takeaways:
* steps to identify business needs that can be translated into measurable
objective through testing strategies
* discover an approach of building a sustainable testing strategies around the
goals you envision
* ideas for implementing POCs to support your testing strategy that enables
people to have a better understanding about the benefits of test automation

# Human-driven test automation strategies
## Session: 1/2 workshop

### Abstract
Users, platforms, technologies, tools, techniques are just some of the
coordinates that add complexity to our daily testing activities. When it comes
to test automation we hope to have a solution to ease our testing process, but
often we end-up having the opposite.
Difficult test automation solutions and complex frameworks are often a recipe
of destruction and
IN my experience as test architect, the success stories on test automation
start from a realistic test strategy which sums up all the coordinates of the
project, applied to a specific context.

Test Strategies are not documents nor power points. are not long emails nor
stories. Test Strategies are a set of guidelines to achieve a specific
objectives.

### Takeaways

What you will learn from this workshop:
- how to identify the scope and objectives of a test strategy
- addressing the test automation at the appropriate application level
- identifying and proofing technical solutions
- how to gain management’s trust to support your approach

What you will have by the end of this workshop:
- a different perspective on how to define your testing strategy
- quick ideas to boost your current test automation process
- a set of references to get you started in your new strategies.

# Automation 3.0 - back to the drawing board
## Session: 45 minutes

* TestAutomationDay NL
In the past years, the testing communities has gone through a series of trends and fashionable approaches. SOAP, Selenium, WebDriver, REST APIs are just a few of the topics that we, the testing community has focused on.
The pyramid of testing levels didn’t help much suggesting the idea of testing layers, coverage, order or testing, etc.

We’re progressing towards serverless architectures. In few years time, applications will be just like Legos. A set of micro services interconnected with few lines of code to deliver a specific business value. All of that having virtualisation in mind. Did you find a critical bug? Build container with previous image, fix problem, re-deploy and that’s it. Part of the testing as we know it will become static analysis of 3 lines of code which enable the integration between external components.

A very basic and common setup nowadays consists of: cloud, virtual containers, microservices, contract-based apis.
Where do we, as testers, find our place in this new setup?
I meet Ops engineers looking for testing people to validate deployment scripts , but there’s a lack of experience in the area. I see architects looking for testing experience to challenge designs, to challenge replication systems, build monkey armies, but there’s little experience in that area.

My talk is about proposing a change of mindset, a change of how as testers should perceive test automation. For the last year, I've done 5 workshops on test automation in which this type of mindset was addressed. "Back to the drawing board" mindset encourages testers to talk more about the design, ideas, implications, processes of test automation and moving aways from the tool-driven approach
