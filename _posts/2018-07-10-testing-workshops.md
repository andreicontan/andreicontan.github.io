# Human-driven test automation strategies
## Session: 1/2 workshop
### Conference
Users, platforms, technologies, tools, techniques are just some of the
coordinates that add complexity to our daily testing activities. When it comes
to test automation we hope to have a solution to ease our testing process, but
often we end-up having the opposite.
Difficult test automation solutions and complex frameworks are often a recipe
of destruction and
IN my experience as test architect, the success stories on test automation
start from a realistic test strategy which sums up all the coordinates of the
project, applied to a specific context.

Test Strategies are not documents nor power points. are not long emails nor
stories. Test Strategies are a set of guidelines to achieve a specific
objectives.

### Takeaways

What you will learn from this workshop:
- how to identify the scope and objectives of a test strategy
- addressing the test automation at the appropriate application level
- identifying and proofing technical solutions
- how to gain management’s trust to support your approach

What you will have by the end of this workshop:
- a different perspective on how to define your testing strategy
- quick ideas to boost your current test automation process
- a set of references to get you started in your new strategies.

# Getting started with REST apis
## Company workshop - 2 days
### Class setup
Transitioning from the monolithic technology era to micro services implementation, one key component is the service oriented architecture (SOA) principle. At the core of SOA lie services which enable various consumer and clients to access the same functionality provided by a back-end server. Getting familiar with RESTful architectural approach is very useful when defining your automated checks strategy. Exploring the system, several questions may arise: how do I identify the APIs? How do I test them? How to write test scripts to against such services? What testing tool can do the job? Many languages, many options - during this workshop, I will help you get started with testing rest services. During the session you will learn: How to choose the right tool for you? Identifying and defining heuristics to test RESTful APIs Writing test scripts Creating test data
Agenda:
- REST Architectures

# Selenium WebDriver based testing from ground up
## Company workshop - 2 or 3 days
### Class setup
- Basics of Testing UI
- Pros and cons of E2E Testing
- Wisely using automation in your Testing
- WebDriver API intro
- Page Modelling

======================================


# APIs workshops - getting comfy working with most of the APIs
## Company workshop - 3 days
### Class setup
Architecture
Ask them about the architecture of their application
Let them draw it - 15’
Present it - 15’
How can you get the architecture? Why is that important? What to do with it? How is data travelling?
Can you acquire it in the next 20 minutes?
Look into different software architectural types: Multitier, Monolithic, Web Apps, Microservices, CMS like
What are the risks of this ones
What can possibly go wrong?
Achieve testability
Communication protocols
How do you actually define a testing strategy? How about a plan?
